## What's New (User Facing)

- User login page
- Create account page
- User preferences page

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

During this sprint, we focused on implementing the user interface for user authentication and preference settings within the TravelBuddy app. We also needed to familiarize ourselves with the new technologies that we were using which added to the time spent to our sprint cycle. Despite the challenges posed by the spring break schedule, significant progress was made in developing the login page, user creation, and user preference.

## Unfinished Work

The work left unfinished was simply due to spring break, due to the members of the team not being able to sit down and code due to other outside situations. The code was not finished but that should not be an issue as we are finishing the code for the unfinished parts this week. The issues not in the review or done category will be added to the next spring under high importance to ensure the completion and quality of the code in a timely manner.
