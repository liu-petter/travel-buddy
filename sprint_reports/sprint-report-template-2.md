## What's New (User Facing)

- Dashboard page
- Create account functionality
- Login page functionality

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

During this sprint we wanted to flesh out the login and create account system. This was because during the first sprint we had focused on developing the user facing interface for these systems and needed to add functionality for the UI we made. This was mainly implemented through the Firebase Authentication API. We also developed a new dashboard interface to show the userâ€™s data when that feature is implemented.

## Unfinished Work

Integration of static .html files into React framework is still pending. These files need to be converted into React components to ensure consistency with the rest of the application structure.
